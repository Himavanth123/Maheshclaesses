docker images -->it will give avilable image list

docker search image name -->to get partickualr image

docker pull image name -->example :docker pull centos
docker run -it centos bash -->once u exit from container it wiil stop working

docker ps -a -->it will give history  of our containers

docker run -dt centos bash -->container will run in baground
docker exec -it containerid bash -->to enter into a container 

docker run --rm -it --name fisrt_container(we will give containe rname which we want to displauy) ubuntu bash -->to avoivd container names

-->docker containers will run on a concept called "Copy on Write" 
-->we can't images but we can edit container
-->containers are usually immutable(epehmeral)-->temorary or dispoable.
if we remove container automatically data also will get remove from container .
so,to avoid or solve this we got Docker volume and bind mounts.

Working with Volumes:
1.To keep data around when container is removed.
2.To share data between host and container 
few point about volumes:
1.A data volume is a specially designed directory in the contanier.
 it is intialized when the container is created.By default it is not deletd
when container is removed/stopeed.
  Data volumes can be shared across containers too.

docker volume ls -->to verify volume list
docker inspect container containerid/containername-->
docker volume inspect volumeid
